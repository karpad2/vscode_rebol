# VSCode extension for [Rebol](http://rebol.com/)

An extension with rich support for the [Rebol language](http://rebol.com/), with features including the following and more:
* hint all syntax errors
* auto completion

Rebol is pronounced "reb-ol".
It's similar to "rebel yell" or "rebel with a cause".
Rebol rebels against the idea that modern software must be large and complex.
Such systems are painfully slow and expensive to develop and maintain. They quickly degrade into chaos, requiring constant updates and patches.
Rebol has been downloaded over 5 million times.
Many of its features have been added to other computer languages, but due to their older, syntax-driven designs, they will never come close to the expressive power of Rebol.
Rebol is nearly syntax free.
And, as you become fluent, you end up writing code in sentences, somewhat similar to human languages. Because our brains are well optimized for sequences of words, Rebol sentences feel natural, and you become more productive.
Rebol invented the concept of dialects.
Dialects provide expressive leverage not found in other languages. They amplify your coding effort by focusing on the essence of what you are trying to do, whether that's creating a user interface or programming a robot's motion.
Rebol is more than just a programming language.
It is also a language for representing data and metadata. It provides a consistent architecture for computation, storage, and exchange of information.
Rebol has been intentionally kept small and lightweight.
It only takes a few seconds to download, requires no special libraries, and includes hundreds of functions, dozens of data-types, built-in help, multiple Internet protocols, graphics, sound, and much more.


Github actions auto updates the version of the extension from now.
